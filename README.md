## üîß Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the Application:

1. Clone the Repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rodercode/PalatePilot.git

4.  Add Existing Files to the Project
    - Open your C++ development environment (e.g., Visual Studio, Code::Blocks).
    - If you see that some files are marked with a red sign (indicating they are missing), follow these steps:
    - Right-click on the solution (or project) in the solution explorer.
    - Select "Add" and then choose "Existing Item..."
    - Navigate to the location of the missing files in the cloned repository and add them to the project.

5. Database Setup:
   Please ensure that your MySQL Server is correctly configured and running. The application expects you to have a functional
   MySQL database in place, which is used for storing user account information and managing your book collection. All the SQL
   queries needed to create the "libraryDB" and populate it with the necessary data can be found in the "SQL" folder for your
   convenience.

6. Run and build the project
